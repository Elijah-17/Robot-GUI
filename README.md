# Robot-GUI
GUI for interfacing with a robot and later connectivity support with an external robotic arm. 

##The Plan
My goal is to create a GUI for simulating and controlling a 6 axis robotic arm. I also plan to simulate tasks and program points in space for the robot to travel to. 
I have no idea how to do this and I have never used python before. 

##How to run
There is a single executable file (application file) that can be opened to run this program. 
 

##The program
The program opens with a simulation viewer and an activate button on the left side and joint sliders on the right.
There is an activate button under the simulation viewer, when activation sucessful, button is replaced by 'Robot connected'
There are joint position sliders on the right side that allow the joints to be controlled 

there is also a program button/tab to open another section of the gui that has programming specific controlls, it shrinks the simulation and has a teach mode. This mode 

 moving the sliders moves the joints. 


I want to have a button called 'program' that opens a second smaller page of the app with joint motion types and a teach button and joint speeds
