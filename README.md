# Robot-GUI
GUI for interfacing with a robot and later connectivity support with an external robotic arm. 

#The Plan
My goal is to create a GUI for simulating and controlling a 6 axis robotic arm. I also plan to simulate tasks and program points in space for the robot to travel to. 
I have no idea how to do this and especially how to view the simulation of the 3d robotic arm
